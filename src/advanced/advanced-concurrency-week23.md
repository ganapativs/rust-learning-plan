# Week 23: Advanced Concurrency Patterns (Advanced)

## Overview

Week 23 dives deep into advanced concurrency patterns in Rust, focusing on building custom synchronization primitives and understanding the internals of Rust's async system. You'll learn how to design sophisticated concurrent systems, implement your own executor, and master low-level concurrency techniques.

## Day 1-3: Custom Synchronization Primitives

### Topics

- Building custom locks and mutexes:
  - Understanding the `std::sync` primitives internals
  - Implementing custom Mutex from scratch
  - Specialized lock implementations
  - Biased locking techniques
  - Reader-writer lock optimizations
- Wait-free algorithms:
  - Lock-free vs wait-free algorithms
  - Hazard pointers
  - Memory reclamation techniques
  - Epoch-based reclamation
  - Wait-free data structures
  - Non-blocking algorithms
- Memory ordering models:
  - Atomic operations in depth
  - Memory barriers
  - Acquire/release semantics
  - Relaxed, Acquire, Release, SeqCst ordering
  - Happens-before relationships
  - The C++/Rust memory model
  - Hardware memory models
- Low-level synchronization:
  - Futexes on Linux
  - Event objects on Windows
  - Park/unpark mechanics
  - Condition variables
  - Barriers and latches
  - Semaphores
