# Week 15: Advanced Design Patterns (Advanced)

## Overview

Week 15 explores sophisticated design patterns that leverage Rust's powerful type system. You'll learn how to use advanced type-level programming techniques, zero-sized types, and state machines to create expressive, type-safe APIs. These patterns enable you to push more guarantees to compile time and reduce runtime errors.

## Day 1-3: Rust-specific Design Patterns

### Topics

- RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) beyond basics:
  - Scoped resources
  - Nested RAII patterns
  - Cleanup guards
- Type-state programming:
  - Encoding state in types
  - State transitions as type transformations
  - Preventing invalid states at compile time
- Compile-time state machines:
  - Encoding state machines in the type system
  - Ensuring valid transitions at compile time
  - Using generics to model state transitions
- The builder pattern in depth:
  - Required vs optional parameters
  - Type-safe builders
  - Validating configurations at compile time
- The visitor pattern:
  - Implementing visitors with traits
  - Recursive visitors
  - Performance considerations
- Composition over inheritance patterns
- Function objects and higher-order functions
- Type erasure techniques

## Day 4-7: Advanced Type System Techniques

### Topics

- Zero-sized types (ZSTs):
  - Creating and using marker types
  - Optimizations with ZSTs
  - Type-level state with ZSTs
- Phantom data and type markers:
  - Using `PhantomData<T>`
  - Type-level state tracking
  - Variance annotations
- Type-level programming:
  - Type-level integers
  - Const generics
  - Type families
  - Leveraging the trait system for type-level computation
- Generic Associated Types (GATs):
  - Using associated types with lifetime parameters
  - Higher-kinded types in Rust
  - Applications of GATs
- Opaque types and `impl Trait`:
  - Return position `impl Trait`
  - Argument position `impl Trait`
  - `type_alias_impl_trait` feature
- Advanced trait bounds:
  - Higher-ranked trait bounds (HRTB)
  - Negative trait bounds
  - Specialization (unstable)
- Type-level macros and derive macros
- The newtype pattern for type safety
