# Week 21: Advanced Optimizations (Advanced)

## Overview

Week 21 focuses on squeezing maximum performance out of Rust code through compiler optimizations and memory-level optimizations. You'll learn how to leverage LLVM's optimization capabilities, optimize memory layout and access patterns, and reduce allocation pressure for peak efficiency and throughput.
