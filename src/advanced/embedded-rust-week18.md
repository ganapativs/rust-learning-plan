# Week 18: Embedded Rust (Advanced)

## Overview

Week 18 introduces embedded systems programming with Rust. You'll learn how to work without the standard library, interact directly with hardware, and build applications for resource-constrained environments. This week combines systems programming knowledge with embedded-specific techniques to create reliable, efficient firmware.

## Day 1-3: Bare-metal Programming

  - Target-specific toolchains
  - Cross-compilation setup
  - Cargo configuration for embedded targets
  - Linker scripts and memory layout
  - Flashing and debugging tools
- Microcontroller programming:
  - Register access patterns
  - Peripheral Access Crates (PACs)
  - Hardware Abstraction Layers (HALs)

3. Create a HAL driver for a sensor using embedded-hal traits
4. Develop an interrupt-based UART communication interface
5. Build a simple real-time scheduler for embedded tasks
6. Create a power-efficient state machine for a battery-powered device

## Advanced Challenges

1. Implement a no_std asynchronous executor for embedded systems
