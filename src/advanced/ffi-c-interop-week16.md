# Week 16: FFI and C Interoperability (Advanced)

## Overview

Week 16 focuses on Rust's Foreign Function Interface (FFI) capabilities, allowing seamless integration with C and other languages. You'll learn how to create and consume C-compatible APIs, manage memory safely across language boundaries, and build reliable bindings to existing libraries. These skills are essential for systems programming and leveraging existing code ecosystems.

## Day 1-3: Rust to C and C to Rust

### Topics

- Understanding C ABI (Application Binary Interface)
- `extern` blocks and functions
- Creating C-compatible Rust APIs:
  - `#[no_mangle]` attribute
  - `extern "C"` function declaration
  - C-compatible types
  - Proper error handling
- Using C libraries from Rust:
  - Declaring external functions
  - Type mappings between Rust and C
  - Handling C error patterns
- The `libc` crate and platform types
- Linking with C code:
  - Static vs dynamic linking
  - Build systems integration
  - Conditional compilation
- Exposing Rust to C/C++:
  - Creating C-compatible libraries
  - Header file generation
  - Packaging for consumption by C/C++
- `cbindgen` and `bindgen` tools

  - Ownership transfer between languages
  - Safe memory handling practices
  - Dealing with malloc/free vs Rust allocators
- Managing C strings and raw pointers:
  - `CStr` and `CString` types
  - String conversion strategies
  - Null termination and safety
- Working with callbacks:
  - Function pointers in FFI
  - Safety considerations with callbacks
  - Closures and FFI
  - Lifetime issues with callbacks
- Handling complex data structures:
  - Slices and arrays
  - Structs with special layout
  - Enums and unions
  - Generic types in FFI
- Async Rust and C interop
- Error handling across FFI boundaries
- Threading and synchronization issues
- Panics and unwinding across language boundaries
- Creating comprehensive bindings with multiple tools

### Use Cases

- Audio/video processing with C libraries
- Game engine integration
- Operating system interfaces
- Hardware acceleration via C libraries
- Plugin systems across language boundaries
- Embedded systems with mixed codebases

## Exercises

1. Create a simple Rust function that can be called from C
2. Write Rust bindings for a small C library
3. Implement a callback system where C code calls into Rust functions
4. Create a wrapper around a C API that provides a safe Rust interface
5. Build a Rust library that can be used from both Rust and C
6. Develop a memory management strategy for resources shared between Rust and C

## Advanced Challenges

1. Create bindings for a complex C library with many types and functions
2. Implement a bidirectional callback system between Rust and C
3. Build a plugin system where C plugins can be loaded into a Rust application
4. Create a safe Rust wrapper for a complex C API with numerous safety concerns
5. Develop a zero-copy data exchange mechanism between Rust and C

## Next Steps

After completing Week 16, you'll be able to confidently integrate Rust with C and other languages through FFI. Week 17 will build on this foundation by exploring low-level programming, including memory-mapped I/O, OS interfaces, and even inline assembly for direct hardware interaction.
