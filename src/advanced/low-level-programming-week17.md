# Week 17: Low-level Programming (Advanced)

## Overview

Week 17 dives into low-level programming with Rust, exploring direct hardware interaction, operating system interfaces, and performance optimization through inline assembly. You'll learn techniques for building systems software, direct memory manipulation, and how to leverage platform-specific features while maintaining Rust's safety guarantees where possible.

  - Page tables and memory protection
- Memory mapping in Rust:
  - Using `mmap` via `libc`
  - Safe abstractions with the `memmap` crate
  - Memory-mapped files
  - Shared memory between processes
- Direct hardware access:
  - Memory-mapped registers
  - Device drivers fundamentals
  - Volatile operations
  - Memory barriers and cache control
  - DMA (Direct Memory Access) concepts
- Platform-specific considerations:
  - Memory ordering
