# Week 13: Advanced Memory Management (Advanced)

## Overview

Week 13 begins the advanced phase of the Rust learning journey, focusing on sophisticated memory management techniques. You'll explore allocators, advanced smart pointer implementations, and complex ownership patterns that push the boundaries of Rust's memory model while maintaining safety.

## Day 1-2: The Allocator Interface

### Topics

- Global allocator and the `GlobalAlloc` trait
- `std::alloc` module in depth
- Custom allocator implementations
- Allocator API and alignment requirements
- Layout calculations and optimizations
- Porting allocators from C/C++
- Using existing allocator libraries:
  - `bumpalo`
  - `mimalloc`
  - `jemalloc`
- Measuring allocator performance

### Resources

### Use Cases

- Building complex data structures (graphs, trees)
- Caching systems with weak references
- Reference-counted resource management
- Shared state in concurrent applications
- Custom containers with specific memory characteristics

## Day 5-7: Advanced Ownership Patterns

### Topics

  - Challenges and approaches
  - Using the `Pin` API
  - `std::pin` module in depth
- Ghost types and phantom data
- Borrowed and owned handles
- The `Cow<T>` (Clone on Write) pattern
- Arena allocation patterns:
  - Using crates like `typed-arena`
  - Region-based memory management
- Ownership in non-lexical contexts
- The `ouroboros` crate for safe self-referential types
- Working with uninitialized memory safely
- Advanced lifetime management

### Use Cases

- Creating async state machines
- Building self-referential data structures
- Managing complex object graphs
- Zero-copy deserialization
- High-performance data processing
- Memory-efficient data manipulation

## Exercises

1. Implement a custom allocator that tracks memory usage
2. Create a self-referential struct using the `Pin` API
3. Build a simple reference-counting smart pointer
4. Implement a memory pool/arena for object allocation
5. Create a data structure that uses `Cow<T>` for efficient cloning
6. Benchmark different allocator implementations for a specific use case

## Advanced Challenges

1. Implement a slab allocator for fixed-size objects
2. Create a safe abstraction for a self-referential structure without external crates
3. Build a custom `Rc<T>` implementation with different trade-offs
4. Design a memory-efficient graph data structure
5. Implement a custom allocator that works in no_std environments

## Next Steps

After completing Week 13, you'll have a deep understanding of Rust's memory management capabilities. Week 14 will build on this knowledge by exploring unsafe Rust and the foundational abstractions that make it safe.
