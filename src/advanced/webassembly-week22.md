# Week 22: WebAssembly with Rust (Advanced)

## Overview

Week 22 explores WebAssembly (Wasm) development with Rust, teaching you how to build high-performance web applications using Rust compiled to WebAssembly. You'll learn about Wasm fundamentals, JavaScript interop, and how to build full-stack Rust applications that run in the browser.

  - Setting up the wasm32 target
  - Using `wasm-pack`
  - Cargo configuration for Wasm
  - Size optimization techniques
  - Debug symbols and source maps
- wasm-bindgen deep dive:
  - JavaScript/Rust FFI
  - Type conversions
  - Memory management
  - Async support
  - Function exports/imports
  - WebIDL bindings
  - Custom sections
- Rust core libraries in Wasm:
  - std vs no_std in Wasm
  - Available APIs in Wasm
  - Working with the web platform
  - Using non-browser Wasm runtimes
- Optimizing Wasm performance:
  - Size optimization
  - Speed optimization
  - Memory usage patterns
  - Threading with Web Workers
  - SIMD support in Wasm

## Exercises

1. Create a simple Rust library compiled to WebAssembly and call it from JavaScript
2. Build a to-do application using Yew or Leptos
3. Implement a WebAssembly-powered image processing function
4. Create a custom WebAssembly component that interacts with the DOM
5. Build a data visualization using Rust, WebAssembly, and Canvas/SVG
6. Implement server-side rendering for a Rust frontend framework

## Advanced Challenges

1. Create a browser-based game using Rust, WebAssembly, and WebGL/WebGPU
2. Build a full-stack application with Rust on both frontend and backend
3. Implement a WebAssembly-powered machine learning model that runs in the browser
4. Create a custom Rust/WebAssembly framework for a specific domain
5. Build a real-time collaborative application using WebAssembly and WebSockets

## Next Steps

After completing Week 22, you'll be able to build sophisticated web applications using Rust and WebAssembly. Week 23 will focus on advanced concurrency patterns, exploring custom synchronization primitives and executors to master Rust's concurrency capabilities.
