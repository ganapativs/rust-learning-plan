# Week 1: Rust Ecosystem (Beginner)

## Overview

This week focuses on getting familiar with the Rust ecosystem before diving into coding. Understanding the tooling, community resources, and project structure will give you a solid foundation.

## Day 1-2: Development Environment & Tools

### Topics

- Installing Rust via rustup
- Understanding rustup's channel system (stable/beta/nightly)
- Configuring VS Code with rust-analyzer
- Basic Cargo commands (new, init, build, run, check, test)
- Cargo.toml structure

### Resources

- [Official Rust Installation Guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [VS Code Rust Setup Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/rust)
- [Rust Book Ch 1](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-00-getting-started.html)
- [Rustup Guide](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/index.html)

### Use Cases

- Setup for all future Rust development
- Understanding how to manage Rust versions and toolchains
- Creating new projects efficiently
- Running and testing code during development

## Day 3-4: Package Management & Project Structure

### Topics

- Understanding the standard project structure
- Cargo.toml vs Cargo.lock
- Adding, updating, and removing dependencies
- Semantic versioning in Rust
- Exploring crates.io and lib.rs
- Binary vs library crates
- Basic module organization

### Resources

- [Cargo Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/)
- [Crates.io](https://crates.io)
- [Lib.rs](https://lib.rs) (Alternative crate registry with better search)
- [Package Layout Convention](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/project-layout.html)

### Use Cases

- Managing project dependencies
- Organizing code in a maintainable way
- Publishing packages to crates.io
- Working with complex project structures

## Day 5-7: Tooling & Community

### Topics

- Essential Cargo extensions:
  - cargo-edit: Add/remove dependencies from command line
  - cargo-watch: Auto-rebuild on file changes
  - cargo-expand: Show expanded macros
  - cargo-outdated: Check for outdated dependencies
  - cargo-audit: Security vulnerability checking
- Code quality tools:
  - Clippy (linting)
  - Rustfmt (formatting)
- Documentation:
  - rustdoc
  - Generating and viewing docs with `cargo doc --open`
- Community resources:
  - Reddit r/rust
  - This Week in Rust newsletter
  - Rust users forum

### Resources

- [Clippy Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/clippy/)
- [Rustfmt Documentation](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustfmt/)
- [This Week in Rust](https://this-week-in-rust.org/)
- [Blessed.rs](https://blessed.rs/crates) (Community-recommended libraries)
- [Rust Users Forum](https://users.rust-lang.org/)

### Use Cases

- Maintaining high-quality code
- Finding solutions to common problems
- Staying up-to-date with Rust developments
- Leveraging community knowledge and best practices

## Exercises

1. Set up your development environment with VS Code and rust-analyzer
2. Create a new project with `cargo new` and explore its structure
3. Add and use a simple dependency like `colored` or `chrono`
4. Run Clippy and Rustfmt on your code
5. Generate documentation for your project with `cargo doc`
6. Explore crates.io to find useful libraries for common tasks

## Next Steps

After completing this week, you'll have a solid understanding of the Rust ecosystem and tooling, preparing you for the syntax and concepts in the upcoming weeks.
