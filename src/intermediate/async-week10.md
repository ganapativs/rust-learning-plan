# Week 10: Async Rust (Intermediate)

## Overview

Week 10 explores asynchronous programming in Rust using the async/await syntax. You'll learn how Rust's approach to async programming enables highly concurrent, non-blocking code without sacrificing safety or performance. This week forms a critical foundation for modern Rust server-side development.

## Day 1-4: Intro to Async/Await

### Topics

- Async programming fundamentals:
  - Blocking vs non-blocking I/O
  - Concurrency vs parallelism
  - Event loops and polling
- The `Future` trait
- Async/await syntax:
  - `async fn` and `async blocks`
  - The `.await` operator
- Understanding zero-cost futures
- Pinning and self-referential structs
- Async lifecycle and state machines
- Cancellation and dropping futures
- Common async patterns:
  - Sequential execution
  - Concurrent execution (`join!`)
  - Select and race (`select!`)
- Task spawning and executors
- Async closures (unstable feature)
- Comparing with JavaScript's Promises and async/await

- Creating async APIs and libraries
- Implementing complex concurrent workflows
- Handling real-time data processing
- Building web servers and APIs
- Creating resilient distributed systems

## Exercises

1. Convert a synchronous file processing program to use async I/O
2. Build a concurrent TCP server with Tokio
3. Implement a rate-limited API client using async/await
4. Create an async data processing pipeline with backpressure
5. Develop a simple chat server using Tokio channels
6. Implement timeouts and cancellation for async operations

## Advanced Challenges

1. Build an async web crawler with concurrent requests
2. Implement a simple HTTP server from scratch using async Rust
3. Create a distributed task processing system with Tokio
4. Develop an async stream processing library
5. Build a real-time notification system using broadcast channels

## Next Steps

After completing Week 10, you'll have a strong foundation in async Rust programming. Week 11 will apply these skills to build a complete command-line application using the Clap library.
