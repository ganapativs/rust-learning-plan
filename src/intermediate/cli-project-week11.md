# Week 11: CLI Project Work (Intermediate)

## Overview

Week 11 is dedicated to building a complete command-line application using Clap for argument parsing. You'll apply the Rust skills you've learned so far to create a practical, feature-rich CLI tool.

## Project Goals

By the end of this week, you'll have built a fully functional CLI application with:

- Robust command-line argument parsing
- Multiple subcommands and options
- Configuration management
- Error handling and reporting
- File I/O operations
- Unit and integration tests
- Documentation and help text

## Day 1-3: Project Setup and Clap Basics

### Topics

- CLI application fundamentals
- Clap basics:
  - Defining commands and subcommands
  - Adding arguments and options
  - Validation rules
  - Environment variable integration
  - Help text generation
- Project structure for CLI apps
- Error handling in CLI contexts
- CLI application testing strategies

### Resources

- [Clap Documentation](https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/)
- [Command Line Apps in Rust](https://rust-cli.github.io/book/index.html)
- [Rust CLI Working Group](https://github.com/rust-cli/team)
- [Building CLI Tools in Rust (Blog)](https://blog.logrocket.com/building-rust-clis-polished-argparse/)
- [Clap Examples](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/tree/master/examples)

### Implementation Steps

1. Initialize a new project with `cargo new <project-name> --bin`
2. Add Clap as a dependency in Cargo.toml
3. Define the basic command structure
4. Implement help text and documentation
5. Create a basic error handling strategy
6. Set up tests for CLI arguments

## Day 4-7: Implementing Core Functionality

### Topics

- Building modular CLI code
- Implementing subcommands
- Handling user input/output:
  - Reading from stdin
  - Writing to stdout/stderr
  - Colorized output
- Working with files and paths
- Configuration management:
  - Config files
  - Environment variables
  - Default settings
- Progress reporting
- Logging and tracing

### Resources

- [anyhow for error handling](https://docs.rs/anyhow/latest/anyhow/)
- [colored for terminal colors](https://docs.rs/colored/latest/colored/)
- [indicatif for progress bars](https://docs.rs/indicatif/latest/indicatif/)
- [config for configuration](https://docs.rs/config/latest/config/)
- [serde for serialization](https://serde.rs/)

### Implementation Steps

1. Implement the core logic for each subcommand
2. Add file operations and data processing
3. Implement configuration management
4. Add progress reporting for long-running operations
5. Create a robust error reporting system
6. Implement logging for debugging

  - Git operations automation
  - Local environment checks

### Network Utility

- **Description**: A tool for network diagnostics and testing
- **Features**:
  - HTTP request testing
  - DNS lookups

  - API endpoint testing

## Advanced Extensions (Optional)

- Add async capabilities with Tokio
- Implement a TUI (Terminal User Interface) with crossterm or tui-rs
- Add plugin architecture using dynamic loading
- Implement shell completions generation
- Create a configuration wizard for first-time users

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this project week, you'll be able to:

- Design and implement a complete CLI application
- Use Clap for robust argument parsing
- Handle errors appropriately in a CLI context
- Write documentation for CLI tools
- Test command-line applications
- Apply multiple Rust concepts in a practical project

## Next Steps

After completing Week 11, you'll have a solid understanding of building CLI applications in Rust. Week 12 will focus on web development with Rust, exploring how to build APIs with frameworks like Axum or Actix Web.
