- Week 14: Unsafe Rust (raw pointers, FFI, safe abstractions)
- Week 15: Advanced Design Patterns (type-state programming, zero-sized types, GATs)

#### Weeks 16-18: Systems Programming

- Week 16: FFI and C Interoperability (C bindings, ABI, callbacks)
- Week 17: Low-level Programming (memory-mapped I/O, OS interfaces, inline assembly)
- Week 18: Embedded Rust (no-std, bare-metal, real-time systems)

#### Weeks 19-21: Performance and Optimization

- Week 19: Performance Analysis (benchmarking, profiling, performance patterns)
- Week 20: SIMD and Parallel Computing (vector intrinsics, rayon, lock-free structures)
- Week 21: Advanced Optimizations (compiler optimizations, memory layout, allocation)

#### Weeks 22-23: Specialized Applications

- Week 22: WebAssembly with Rust (wasm-bindgen, frontend frameworks)
- Week 23: Advanced Concurrency Patterns (custom synchronization, executors, futures)

### Phase 4: Expert (Week 24)

- Week 24: Capstone Project (combining multiple advanced concepts)

## Curriculum Structure

Each week's plan includes:

- Daily topics with progressive complexity
- Curated learning resources (official docs, books, videos)
- Real-world use cases and applications
- Hands-on exercises and projects
- Advanced challenges for deeper exploration

## How to Use This Plan

1. Each week has a dedicated markdown file in the corresponding difficulty directory
2. Files follow the naming pattern: `<topic>-week<number>.md`
3. Each file contains:
   - Detailed topics to be covered
   - Links to resources
   - Use cases for each concept
   - Exercises and challenges

## Time Commitment & Learning Style

This curriculum is designed for approximately 2 hours of daily focused learning, combining:

- Conceptual learning from documentation and resources
- Practical coding exercises and experiments
- Progressive project development
- Regular review and practice

## Documentation Organization

This learning plan is organized into four main documentation sections:

1. **Overview** (this document) - High-level summary and guidance
2. **Rust Ecosystem** - Comprehensive guide to Rust tooling, community, and resources
3. **Plan** - Detailed week-by-week learning curriculum
4. **Reading Materials** - Curated list of learning resources by skill level

## Skill Progression

### Beginner Phase (Weeks 1-6)

By the end of the beginner phase, you'll understand:

- Rust's unique ownership model and memory safety guarantees
- Basic syntax, control flow, and data types
- Structs, enums, and pattern matching
- Error handling approaches
- Package and module organization

### Intermediate Phase (Weeks 7-12)

The intermediate phase builds on fundamentals to cover:

- Generics and trait-based programming
- Lifetimes and advanced type patterns
- Concurrency primitives and parallel execution
- Async programming with futures and tasks
- Practical application development (CLI, web)

### Advanced Phase (Weeks 13-23)

The advanced phase explores systems programming concepts:

- Advanced memory management techniques
- Unsafe Rust operations with safe abstractions
- Advanced design patterns unique to Rust
- FFI and interoperability with C code
- Low-level systems programming
- Embedded development without the standard library
- Performance analysis and optimization techniques
- SIMD and vectorized computation
- WebAssembly development
- Advanced concurrency patterns

### Expert Phase (Week 24)

The expert phase focuses on:

- Capstone project combining multiple advanced concepts
- Applying knowledge from all previous weeks to create a complex application

## Prerequisites

### For Beginner Phase (Weeks 1-6)

- Programming experience (ideally JavaScript/TypeScript)
- Basic understanding of computer science concepts
- Familiarity with command-line tools

### For Intermediate Phase (Weeks 7-12)

- Solid understanding of Rust fundamentals, including ownership
- Experience with basic Rust syntax and concepts
- Completion of beginner exercises

### For Advanced Phase (Weeks 13-23)

- Experience with traits, generics, and lifetimes
- Comfort with concurrent and async Rust programming
- Completed at least one substantial Rust project

### For Expert Phase (Week 24)

- Mastery of all previous concepts
- Experience with multiple Rust projects
- Understanding of systems-level programming concepts

## Resources

The plan incorporates various learning resources:

- The Rust Book (official documentation)
- Rust By Example
- Rustlings exercises
- Topic-specific books and tutorials
- Community resources and blogs
- Advanced books like "Rust for Rustaceans" and "The Rustonomicon"

See the [reading-materials.md](reading-materials.md) file for a comprehensive list of resources for all skill levels.

## Getting Started

Begin with [Week 1: Rust Ecosystem](beginner/ecosystem-week1.md) to set up your development environment and understand the Rust ecosystem before diving into coding.

For advanced topics (weeks 13-23), it's essential to have completed or be comfortable with all the beginner and intermediate topics first.

You can use [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/) to practice and experiment with Rust code.

## Progress Tracking Recommendations

Consider tracking your progress by:

1. Creating a GitHub repository for your learning journey
2. Committing code exercises and projects regularly
3. Maintaining notes on concepts learned and challenges encountered
4. Creating a learning journal to document your experience
5. Building a portfolio of Rust projects as you progress

This curriculum provides a structured path to Rust mastery, blending theoretical knowledge with practical application at each stage of the journey.
